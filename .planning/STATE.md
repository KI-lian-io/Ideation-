# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** German output is native-quality and trustworthy — norm-correct, never fabricated — so a German recruiter takes the applicant seriously in the 8-second scan.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 — Pre-flight + Parse Flow

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 5 (Pre-flight + Parse Flow)
Plan: 0 of TBD in current phase
Status: Ready to plan

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Research 5-phase structure adopted verbatim (Node upgrade hard prerequisite; parse before cover-letter; analytics before deploy; design after working flow; distribution last)
- Architecture: `useReducer` for step machine; `resumeText` must persist through all steps for `/api/cover-letter`; no Vercel AI SDK
- PostHog: `autocapture:false`, `ip:false`, `person_profiles:'identified_only'` are mandatory before any public traffic

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Local Node is 18.14.0 — Next 16 requires ≥20.9.0. Fix this before any `npm install` or `dev` run (PRE-01 is Phase 1 task 1).
- Vercel plan tier must be confirmed before Phase 4 deploy — Hobby caps cover-letter stream at 60s.
- Native-speaker quality gate required before Phase 4 goes public.
