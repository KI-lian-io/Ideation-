# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-06-22)

**Core value:** German output is native-quality and trustworthy — norm-correct, never fabricated — so a German recruiter takes the applicant seriously in the 8-second scan.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — distribution-operationalization

## Current Position

Phase: 6 — Analytics (post-launch)
Plan: Not started
Status: Executing Phase 05
Last activity: 2026-06-24 — Phase 05 complete, transitioned to Phase 6

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Research 5-phase structure adopted verbatim (Node upgrade hard prerequisite; parse before cover-letter; analytics before deploy; design after working flow; distribution last)
- Architecture: `useReducer` for step machine; `resumeText` must persist through all steps for `/api/cover-letter`; no Vercel AI SDK
- PostHog: `autocapture:false`, `ip:false`, `person_profiles:'identified_only'` are mandatory before any public traffic
- [Phase 03]: RESUME_LIMIT = 30_000 named constant in both server and client; isSubmitDisabled OR-extended to preserve base empty-check
- [Phase 03]: Counter format uses toLocaleString('de-DE') to match German number conventions (period as thousands separator)
- [Phase ?]: CV_LIMIT/POSTING_LIMIT/ANSWER_LIMIT as named constants in both server and client
- [Phase ?]: NextResponse.json 400 shape on cover-letter route aligned to /api/parse (D-03)
- [Phase ?]: canSubmit AND-extended to preserve base non-empty check plus over-limit gates
- [Phase ?]: Brand foundation + route split
- [Phase ?]: Brand foundation + route split
- [Phase ?]: Brand foundation + route split
- [Phase ?]: Landing page motion implemented without 'use client' wrapper
- [Phase ?]: metadataBase deferred to Plan 03 (needs Vercel deploy URL)

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Local Node is 18.14.0 — Next 16 requires ≥20.9.0. Fix this before any `npm install` or `dev` run (PRE-01 is Phase 1 task 1).
- Vercel plan tier must be confirmed before Phase 5 deploy — Hobby caps cover-letter stream at 60s.
- Native-speaker quality gate required before Phase 5 goes public.
